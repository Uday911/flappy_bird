## Overview
Reinforcement Learning agents for playing flappy-bird game

## PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
Deep reinforcement learning using a PPO model written in Tensorflow.<br>
The Flappy Bird Gym environment was mastered in 9 hours of training using a CPU with 8 cores and a GPU. Training and evaluation code is available at [dppo.ipynb](https://github.com/dguoy/flappy_bird/blob/master/dppo.ipynb)
